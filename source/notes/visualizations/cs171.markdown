##Lec.1 Introduction

###What is visualization?

To convey information through graphical representations of data

###Visualization goals:

- **Record** information
- **Analyze** data to support reasoning
  * Develop and assess hypotheses(visual exploration)
  * Find patterns and discover errors data
- **Communicate** information to others
  * Share and persuade(visual explanation)

##Lec.2 Design Principles

Clutter and confusion are not attributes of information, they are failures of
design - E.Tufte

###Tufte's Integrity Principles:

- Show data variation, not design variation
- Clear, detailed, and through labeling and approriate scales
- Size of the graphcis effect should be directly proportinal to the numerical quantities

###Tufte's Design Principles:

- Maximize data-ink ratio
- Avoid chart junk
- Increase data density
- Layering of information

##Lec.3 Data Models & Visual Variables

###Data Types:

- **Nominal(Categorical)**
  * Are = or $\neq$ to other values
- **Ordinal**
  * Obey a < relationship
<!--- -->
- **Quantitative**
  * Can do arithmetic on them
  * Interval (no "true zero"): dates, location. Cannot compare directly. Only differences can be compared.
  * Ratio (zero fixed): Origin is meaningful, can measure ratios & proportions.

###Data vs. Conceptual Model:

- **Data Model**: Low-level description of the data(1D floats, 3D vector of floats)
- **Conceptual Model**: Mental construction(temperature, space)

###Bertin's Visual Variables:

**Objectives**: Points, Lines, Areas

**Channels**: Position, Size, (Grey)Value, Texture, Color, Orientation, Shape

- **Points**: Strongest visual variable; Suitable for all data types
  * Sometimes not available
  * Cluttering
- **Size & Length**: Good visual variable; Easy to see whether one is bigger; Grouping works
  * Good for aligned bars
  * OK for changes in length
  * Bad for changes in area
- **Shape**: Great to recognize many classes
  * No grouping, ordering
- **Value**: Good for quantitative data when length & size are used; Supports grouping; Is preattentive if sufficiently different
  * Not very many shades recognizable
- **Color**: Good for qualitative data; Is preattentive if sufficiently different
  * Limited number of classes
  * Not good for quantitative data
  * Lots of pitfalls! Be careful!

###Characteristics of Visual Variables:

- **Selective**: Is a mark distinct from other marks?
- **Associative**: Does it supporting grouping?
- **Quantitative**: Can we quantify the difference between two marks?
- **Order**: Can we see a change in order?
- **Length**: How many unique marks can we make?

###Graphical Perception:

##Lec.4 Interaction

###The Shneiderman Mantra: Overview first, zoom and filter, and details on demand.

- Focus + Context
- Brushing & Linking
- Filtering
- Zooming
- Animation

##Lec.5 Networks & Trees

TBD

##Lec.6 Data Visualization Process & Graphs

- **Target**
  * Choose a specific domain
  * Define research question(s)
  * Find & clean the data
- **Translate** (What? 80%)
  * Formulate data analysis tasks
  * Exploratory data analysis
  * Transform & summarize data
- **Design** (How? 20%)
  * Design visual encodings
  * Design interactions
  * Sketch *many* ideas!
- **Implement**
  * Use code "sketches"
  * Define data structures
  * Find efficient algorithms
- **Validate**
  * Is the visualization effective?
  * Does it support the tasks?
  * Does it provide new insights?

**Comparisions:** Bar Chart, Waterfall Chart, Dot Plots

Bar Chart vs. Line Chart: Line implies trend. Do not use for categorical data.

Two line segments are maximally discriminable when their average absolute angle is $45^\circ$.

**Trends Over Time:** Line Chart, Streamgraphs

**Proportions:** Pie Chart, Donut CHart, Stacked Bar Chart, Small Multiples, Stacked Area Chart

**Distribution:** Histogram, Density Plots, Box & Whisker Plots

**Correlations:** Scatterplots, Trend Lines, Residual Graph, Quadrants, Path Plots

##Lec.7 High-Dimensional Data

![Highdimensional Data](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7515/15581865510_5d501c5cf2_o.png)

- How many dimensions?
  * ~50: tractable with "just" vis
  * ~1000 - need analytical methods
- How many records?
  * ~1000 - "just" vis is fine
  * \>10,000 - need analytical methods
- Homogeneity?
  * Same data type?
  * Same scales?

###Geometric Methods

- **Parallel Coordinates**: Shows primarily relationships between adjacent axis
  * Each axis represents dimension
  * Lines connecting axis represent records
  * Suitable for all tabular data typesa (Also heterogeneous data)
  * Limited scalability (~50 dimensions, ~1-5k records)
  * Interaction is crucial: Axis reordering, Brushing, Filtering
- **Star Plot**: Similar to parallel coordinates, radiate from a common origin
- **Small Multiples**: Use multiple views to show different partitions of a dataset
- **Scatterplot Matrices(SPLOM)**: Matrix of size d*d, each cell plots a scatterplot of two dimensions
  * Limited scalability (~20 dimensions, ~500-1k records)
  * Brushing is important
  * Often combined with "Focus Scatterplot" as F+C technique
- **Others**: Connected Charts, Domino, etc.

###Pixel Based Methods

- Each cell is a "pixel", value encoded in color/value
- Meaning derived from ordering
- If no ordering inherent, clustering is used
- Good for homogeneous dataset
- Color is relative!(Also should consider the blindness)

###Dimensionality Reduction

- Principal Component Analysis(PCA)
  * Linear mapping, by order of variance
- Multidimensional Scaling(MDS)
  * Nonlinear, better suited for some dataset
  * Popular for text analysis

**Can we trust dimensionality reduction?**: [Interpretation and Trust: Designing Model-Driven Visualizations for Text Analysis](http://vis.stanford.edu/papers/designing-model-driven-vis)
