Harvard CS171 - Visualization by Hanspeter Pfister

##Lec.1 Introduction

###What is visualization?

To convey information through graphical representations of data

###Visualization goals:

- **Record** information
- **Analyze** data to support reasoning
  * Develop and assess hypotheses(visual exploration)
  * Find patterns and discover errors data
- **Communicate** information to others
  * Share and persuade(visual explanation)

##Lec.2 Design Principles

Clutter and confusion are not attributes of information, they are failures of
design - E.Tufte

###Tufte's Integrity Principles:

- Show data variation, not design variation
- Clear, detailed, and through labeling and approriate scales
- Size of the graphcis effect should be directly proportinal to the numerical quantities

###Tufte's Design Principles:

- Maximize data-ink ratio
- Avoid chart junk
- Increase data density
- Layering of information

##Lec.3 Data Models & Visual Variables

###Data Types:

- **Nominal(Categorical)**
  * Are = or $\neq$ to other values
- **Ordinal**
  * Obey a < relationship
<!--- -->
- **Quantitative**
  * Can do arithmetic on them
  * Interval (no "true zero"): dates, location. Cannot compare directly. Only differences can be compared.
  * Ratio (zero fixed): Origin is meaningful, can measure ratios & proportions.

###Data vs. Conceptual Model:

- **Data Model**: Low-level description of the data(1D floats, 3D vector of floats)
- **Conceptual Model**: Mental construction(temperature, space)

###Bertin's Visual Variables:

**Objectives**: Points, Lines, Areas

**Channels**: Position, Size, (Grey)Value, Texture, Color, Orientation, Shape

- **Points**: Strongest visual variable; Suitable for all data types
  * Sometimes not available
  * Cluttering
- **Size & Length**: Good visual variable; Easy to see whether one is bigger; Grouping works
  * Good for aligned bars
  * OK for changes in length
  * Bad for changes in area
- **Shape**: Great to recognize many classes
  * No grouping, ordering
- **Value**: Good for quantitative data when length & size are used; Supports grouping; Is preattentive if sufficiently different
  * Not very many shades recognizable
- **Color**: Good for qualitative data; Is preattentive if sufficiently different
  * Limited number of classes
  * Not good for quantitative data
  * Lots of pitfalls! Be careful!

###Characteristics of Visual Variables:

- **Selective**: Is a mark distinct from other marks?
- **Associative**: Does it supporting grouping?
- **Quantitative**: Can we quantify the difference between two marks?
- **Order**: Can we see a change in order?
- **Length**: How many unique marks can we make?
