My name is [Yanhong Wu (武延宏)](http://yhwu.me), currently a Ph.D. student at
[VisLab](http://vis.cse.ust.hk), Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of
Science and Technology(HKUST). My supervisor is [Prof. Huamin Qu](http://huamin.org). I got my bachelor
degree at Software School, Fudan University in June 2013. During my college
study, I was an undergraduate researcher of Institute of Parallel and
Distributed Systems, advised by [Prof. Haibo Chen](http://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/haibo_chen).

My research interests include Information Visualization, Visual Analytics and Human-Computer Interaction.

I love Computer Science and I usually study interesting topics like
Functional Programming, Machine Learning and Synchronization Primitives as
my hobbies. In my spare time, I like solving algorithm puzzles and playing
guitar for fun. I am also a faithful fan of Real Madrid.
