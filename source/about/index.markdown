My name is [Yanhong Wu (武延宏)](http://yhwu.me), currently a Ph.D. student at VisLab,
Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of
Science and Technology. My supervisor is Prof. Huamin Qu. I got my bachelor
degree at Software School, Fundan University in June 2013. During my college
study, I was an undergraduate researcher of Institute of Parallel and
Distributed Systems, advised by Prof. Haibo Chen.

My research interests include Information Visualization, Social Network
Analysis and Human-Computer Interaction.

I love Computer Science and I usually study interesting topics like
Functional Programming, Machine Learning and Synchronization Primitives as
my hobbies. In my spare time, I like solving algorithm puzzles and playing
guitar for fun. I am also a faithful fan of Real Madrid.
